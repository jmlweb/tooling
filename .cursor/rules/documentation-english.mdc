# Documentation Language Rule

> **Note**: This rule is also documented in `AGENTS.md` for compatibility with other AI agents. This file provides Cursor-specific metadata.

All documentation in this project must be written in English.

## Scope

This rule applies to:
- README files (README.md, README.txt, etc.)
- Specification documents (SPECS.md, SPEC.md, etc.)
- Documentation files in the `docs/` directory
- Code comments within documentation files
- Any other markdown or text documentation files

## Exceptions

Code comments within source code files (`.ts`, `.js`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, etc.) may be in any language, though English is preferred for consistency.

## Enforcement

When creating or editing documentation files, ensure all content is in English. This applies to both human-written and AI-generated documentation.

For complete details, see `AGENTS.md`.
