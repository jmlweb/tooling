# Use Latest Stable Versions Rule

> **Note**: This rule is also documented in `AGENTS.md` for compatibility with other AI agents. This file provides Cursor-specific metadata.

Always use the latest stable versions of tools and packages for internal development and dependencies.

## Scope

This rule applies to:
- Node.js and runtime versions
- Package dependencies (in `package.json` files)
- Development tools (Turborepo, Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript, etc.)
- Build tools and bundlers
- Testing frameworks
- Any other development dependencies

## Guidelines

1. **Check for Updates**: Before adding or updating dependencies, check for the latest stable version
2. **Stable Versions Only**: Use stable releases, avoid beta, alpha, or release candidate versions unless specifically required
3. **Version Pinning**: While using latest stable versions, pin exact versions in `package.json` for reproducibility
4. **Regular Updates**: Periodically review and update dependencies to maintain current stable versions
5. **Security**: Latest stable versions often include security patches, so staying current is important

## Published Packages Node.js Compatibility

All exported packages must be compatible with all Node.js versions that are still supported by the Node.js project.

### Requirements

- **Check Node.js Support**: Verify which Node.js versions are currently in Active LTS, Maintenance LTS, or Current release status
- **Minimum Version**: Set the `engines.node` field in `package.json` to the oldest supported Node.js version
- **Testing**: Test packages against all supported Node.js versions to ensure compatibility
- **Documentation**: Document Node.js version requirements in package README files

### Node.js Support Lifecycle

- **Active LTS**: Fully supported with regular updates
- **Maintenance LTS**: Security updates only
- **Current**: Latest features, but may not be stable

Packages should support at minimum all Active LTS versions, and ideally all Maintenance LTS versions as well.

## Exceptions

- If a specific version is required for compatibility reasons, document why
- If a newer stable version introduces breaking changes that require significant refactoring, evaluate the trade-off
- For published packages, consider compatibility with consumers when updating major versions

## Enforcement

When adding new dependencies or updating existing ones:
- Verify the latest stable version is available
- Use exact version numbers (avoid `^` or `~` unless there's a specific reason)
- Document any exceptions to this rule
- Update dependencies regularly to maintain security and compatibility

When creating or updating published packages:
- Verify Node.js compatibility requirements
- Set appropriate `engines.node` field in `package.json`
- Test against all supported Node.js versions
- Update compatibility requirements as Node.js versions reach end-of-life

For complete details, see `AGENTS.md`.
