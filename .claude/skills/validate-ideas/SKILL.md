# Validate Ideas (Batch)

Review and validate all pending ideas in a single session.

## Instructions

When the user runs `/validate-ideas`:

### Step 1 - Fetch All Pending Ideas

```bash
gh issue list --repo jmlweb/tooling --label "idea:pending" --json number,title,body --limit 50
```

If no pending ideas, inform the user and exit.

### Step 2 - Analyze Each Idea

For each pending idea:

1. Read the issue content
2. Evaluate effort and impact
3. Determine recommendation (accept/reject)
4. Note reasoning

### Step 3 - Present Summary Table

Display all ideas with recommendations:

```text
Pending Ideas Analysis:

| #   | Title                          | Effort | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|
| #12 | Add JSON schema validation     | Low    | High   | ✅ Accept      |
| #15 | Generate TS types from schemas | Medium | High   | ✅ Accept      |
| #18 | Dark mode for docs             | High   | Low    | ❌ Reject      |
| #20 | Add logging utility            | Low    | Medium | ✅ Accept      |

Details:
- #12: Quick win, improves data integrity
- #15: Significant DX improvement, worth the effort
- #18: High effort for cosmetic change, out of scope
- #20: Useful utility, easy to implement
```

### Step 4 - Ask for Confirmation

Options:

1. **Apply all** - Accept/reject all as recommended
2. **Select** - Let user choose which to apply
3. **Cancel** - Make no changes

### Step 5 - Apply Decisions

For each confirmed decision, execute the same logic as `/validate-idea`:

- Add appropriate labels (effort, impact, accepted/rejected)
- Add validation comment
- Close rejected issues

### Step 6 - Show Summary

```text
Validation complete:

✅ Accepted: #12, #15, #20
❌ Rejected: #18

3 ideas ready for /feed-backlog
1 idea rejected and closed
```

## Efficiency Tips

- Process ideas in priority order (quick wins first)
- Group similar ideas for consistent evaluation
- Note dependencies between ideas
- Flag potential duplicates
